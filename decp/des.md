The final year project is the culmination of the degree â€“ it gives students a chance to demonstrate all they have learned. The project module is very different from other modules. Although students are supervised, the onus is on the student to define the problem boundaries, investigate possible solutions, and present the results in writing, verbally, and inaction. Apart from an initial briefing session, there are no formal lectures to attend. Teaching consists of regular individual/small group meetings to discuss progress. For assessment, students submit reports of their progress and final results and give in-person presentations and demonstrations of their work.
